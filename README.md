The Employee Manangement System project is made to utilise and manage the employee details. The Employee Management System login interface is designed with a role-based access system,providing distinct options for employees and adminstrations.New Employees are restricted from logging in intially,ensuring the security and integrity of the system. On the other hand, administrators have privileged access, allowing them to log in and carry out administrative tasks. Admins can seamlessly add new employee entries directly through the interface, and the entered data is subsequently stored in the database. This dual-tiered login approach not only protects sensitive information by limiting access for regular employees but also empowers administrators with the capability to manage and update the employee database efficiently.
